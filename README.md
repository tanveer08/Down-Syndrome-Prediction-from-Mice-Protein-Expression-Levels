# Down-Syndrome-Prediction-from-Mice-Protein-Expression-Levels
Binary and Quaternary Classification for Down Syndrome Prediction from Mice Protein Expression Levels
1. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, eliminated the correlated variables and imputed missing variables
2. Trained and tuned hyperparameters for Linear & RBF kernel SVM, Neural Network & Random Forest models
3. Utilized RFECV analysis to identify crucial proteins and eliminate variables to achieve 97% accuracy
